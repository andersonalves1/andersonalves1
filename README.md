**Hello, my name is Anderson Alves**, web developer and business man at Yoopih. I am studying Computer Science, but I have Technical Training in Production and Web Design, and courses that include Full Stack Web and Mobile (Node.js, React e React Native), , HTML5, CSS3, Git and GitHub, Kotlin, UI/UX Skills, Photoshop, Figma, Wordpress, Scrum and Programming Logic.

I had experience abroad in South Africa, Singapore and Venezuela, where it helped me learn to communicate well in English and Spanish. I was also a Professional Soccer Athlete for a few years, and it taught me a lot to work as a team.

My goal is to provide quality service, achieve solutions collaboratively, adding value to partners and customers. In my 4 years of experience, I worked providing services in small and medium companies.

I am always looking for knowledge and tools to help in the best way in the work I am involved in, which I do with inspiration and motivation.
