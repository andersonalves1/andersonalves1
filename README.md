**Hello, my name is Anderson Alves**, web developer and business man at Yoopih. I am studying Computer Science, but I have Technical Training in Production and Web Design, and courses that include Stack Node.js, Git and GitHub, HTML5, CSS3, Wordpress, cPanel , WHM, Photoshop, Premier and Programming Logic.

I had experience abroad, in South Africa and Singapore, that helped me to learn English and to be able to communicate well in the language. I was also a Professional Soccer Athlete for a few years, and it taught me a lot to work as a team.

My goal is to provide quality service, achieve solutions collaboratively, adding value to partners and customers. In my 10 years of experience, I worked providing services in small, medium and large companies.

I am always looking for knowledge and tools to help in the best way in the work I am involved in, which I do with inspiration and motivation.
